# AI Indoor Air Quality Health Predictor

I am building an AI-powered indoor air quality monitoring and health prediction system using a Raspberry Pi. The system continuously measures indoor environmental conditions and uses edge AI to predict potential health effects such as fatigue, headaches, poor sleep quality, and respiratory discomfort. Unlike traditional monitors, this project focuses on actionable health insights, not just raw sensor data.
